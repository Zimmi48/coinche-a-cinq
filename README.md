This app is written in [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/) with [Lamdera](https://dashboard.lamdera.app/docs/starting) and [Elm-UI](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/elm-ui/latest/).

Lamdera can be installed using the [official installers](https://dashboard.lamdera.app/docs/download), which are also wrapped in nixpkgs (`elmPackages.lamdera`).

Use `lamdera live` to run and debug locally (unfortunately many browsers / private browsing sessions are needed to simulate 5 players).

Use `elm-format` to format the source code.
